MasterMind
==========

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)[Mastermind] is
a simple board game, where one player makes a guess and the other
player tries to find what the guess was in as little attempts as
possible.

In this implementation, the computer always makes the guess, and the
human player tries to find out.

Each guess is a sequence of colors. Colors may repeat. The standard
implementation has 6 colors and the sequence itself is of size 4.
For every attempt, the computer reports how many were exact matches
and in the remaining, how many colors matched.

In order to debug the program itself, and for verification, the
computer prints the original guess to /tmp/current_guess.

$ ./mastermind.py
Allowed colors are: R P Y G W B
Enter a guess of size 4, separated by white spaces:R P Y G
Rights: 0, color matches: 3. Attempts so far: 1

Enter a guess of size 4, separated by white spaces:W R P Y
Rights: 0, color matches: 2. Attempts so far: 2

Enter a guess of size 4, separated by white spaces:B G R P
Rights: 1, color matches: 2. Attempts so far: 3

Enter a guess of size 4, separated by white spaces:B G R R
Rights: 0, color matches: 2. Attempts so far: 4

Enter a guess of size 4, separated by white spaces:G B B P
Rights: 2, color matches: 1. Attempts so far: 5

Enter a guess of size 4, separated by white spaces:G B P P
Rights: 2, color matches: 1. Attempts so far: 6

Enter a guess of size 4, separated by white spaces:G B G P
Rights: 3, color matches: 0. Attempts so far: 7

Enter a guess of size 4, separated by white spaces:Y B G P
You got it!
$ cat /tmp/current_guess
Guess is Y B G P
